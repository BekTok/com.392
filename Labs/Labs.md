Lab Tasks
=========

Students will have to build small programs during labs to take a look at
hardware effects or familiarize themselves with the fundamentals of a particular
parallel or distributed API.

You can use the AUCA server for this work through SSH at 'auca.space'. The login
has the format `<last name>_<first letter of the first name>`.

## Lab #1, Data Hazards

In the first lab, you will be given an example program to illustrate the data
dependency hazards that limit a superscalar CPU's parallelism.

Refer to the `data.c` file in the `Source` directory.

## Lab #2, Control Hazards

In the second lab, you will get an example program to illustrate the control
dependencies that limit a pipelined CPU's parallelism.
